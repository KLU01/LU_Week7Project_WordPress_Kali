## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

1) Finding good resources describing the vulnerabilities and examples
2) Although the IP stated was 127.0.53.53 when wpdistillery.dev was pinged, it was actually 192.168.33.10.
3) The hostname I found worked for me was not wpdistillery.dev but wpdistillery.local.
